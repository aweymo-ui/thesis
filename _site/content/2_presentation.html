<p>My interest in iconographic commercial imagery can be traced back to a document I found while working as an archivist for the Tacoma Northwest Room in 2022, processing the materials of Puget Sound historian Murray Morgan. Amongst the drafts of his work, research materials, correspondence and historical photographs was an authorless catalog of log brands, corporate imagery that served the same purpose as animal branding, a stamp of ownership to deter or prosecute any potential thieves who may emerge in the timber’s path between the forest and the sawmill. There was something very interesting I found in these icons, designed to be “read” by two specific groups: employees within the timber company and people who intended to steal from them, while remaining utterly innocuous to the general public.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Since then, I’ve become interested in the progression of early commercial imagery such as advertising, logos, packaging and branding, in relation to the development of printing technology. Particularly, I’m interested in the advent of what some historians call the “new advertising” movement around 1900, when imagery ceased becoming ornate and referential to the founders or their factories in a “signatory style” one might associate with stationary letterheads. Instead, commercial imagery simplified and became iconographic, like the timber brands, into what historian Jennifer M. Black calls “a logo-based language, a hieroglyphic set of graphic signifiers”. Historian Roland Marchand contended these simplified images “aroused less psychological resistance” and played into advertiser’s belief that “the eye gets the facts quicker and more graphically than the mind.”</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>How did the iconographic turn in American commercial imagery reflect broader cultural, economic, and political transformations in the Inland Empire? Scaffolding this central question, I am interested in exploring ways in which this iconographic turn also involved brand permanence in favor of consumer interactivity, its power in allowing commercial images to be “read” by the consumer unconsciously and its contemporaneous emergence with the formation of national and international trade routes and a more diverse American citizenry. 
Project Outline and Reasoning</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>To engage with these questions, I am proposing a public-facing digital project on the social influences that shaped commercial imagery in the Inland Empire from the gilded age through the progressive era. In the digital exhibit, I am envisioning one section that is a 20-25 page text portion that fulfills the graduate student handbook requirement for a seminar-length paper. This section will provide the reader with my thesis, literature review, methodology, and findings. On another portion of the site I am considering a map where selecting a node would allow visitors to examine a carousel of the artifact, the company and founders which could be expanded to a full screen lightbox, the object’s provenance and chronological metadata and a timeline of the company’s life span that can be toggled to contrast this with significant regional and national events. All this is in effort to convey the ideas put forth in the thesis interactively and give readers a better sense of these objects in time and space.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I believe that examining commercial imagery from the gilded age through the progressive era is a culturally insightful 40 year window. Some of the first materials that we would recognize as modern advertising emerged during this time, well before the concept of “branding” and public relations. Despite the incredible influence of advertising and public relations on American culture, historical analysis of these materials remains critically under researched in the academic landscape, particularly outside of the focus of New York and Chicago agencies.</p>

<p>Regarding geographic focus on the Inland Empire, the area is uniquely well suited to this study as a somewhat isolated agricultural and industrial ecosystem that may speak more directly to regional events and trends and yield more concise findings than a broader area of focus. Critically, I find Spokane a unique subject area because its time frame of development and recession almost exactly map onto the formation of the advertising industry in the United States.</p>

<p>I am also interested in studying the region because of the extremely relevant holdings of the Northwest Museum of Arts &amp; Culture in Spokane, where I will be collaborating with the institution’s curator to digitize materials in May. The museum’s Joel E. Ferris Research Archives houses an incredibly unique collection of commercial and folk objects, ranging from quilts, commercial poster art, wholesale and retail packaging and commercial ephemera from this time period.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Because of the visual and comparative nature of this thesis, I believe a public history digital exhibit for this material would not only be the most compelling format but also the most pedagogically intuitive. Readers will be able to view the objects from multiple angles and engage with high definition close ups of the material, which is vital to understanding the printing and packaging technology used in their creation and how they physically persisted or degraded over time. Additionally, the visualization section of the site will allow readers to contrast and compare materials along with their associated metadata and descriptions to engage with my thesis findings interactively.</p>

<p>Regarding who would benefit from this scholarship, I want to design the project so a diverse audience can engage with it. Academics in advertising and material history will have the knowledge base to use the text portion of the site, while readers with no formal training could use the visualization portion of the exhibit as a dynamic pedagogical tool. Additionally, the work will provide the Northwest Museum of Arts &amp; Culture with hundreds of high-resolution photographs of undigitized portions of their collections and the site can be a showcase for innovative approaches at University of Idaho that are still rooted in traditional historical discipline.</p>

<p>Methodologically, I am interested in approaching this project employing material history and structuralist approaches. Gunn and Faire’s Research Methods for History and Gerritsen and Riello’s Writing Material Culture History have been instructive overviews of the origins of material culture, it’s roots in archaeology and art history as well as its usefulness in reaching across disciplines to form new connections through quantitative approaches.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>While certainly more associated with environmental history, William Cronon’s Nature’s Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West is very influential to this project in its structuralist approach to understand the interconnectedness and interdependence of the development of trades in the formation of Chicago and the commercial imagery which supported that growth. Cronon creates a compelling portrait of how train, vehicle, radio and telephone technology “annihilated space,” in the words of an early AT&amp;T campaign, abstracting previous notions of commerce. The void this created between producer and consumer was filled with symbolic commercial imagery such as newspaper ads, posters and catalogs, becoming a signature, a handshake or tour of the factory in printed form.</p>

<p><br /></p>
<div class="symbol-container">
    <p class="symbol">&#10042;</p>
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Roland Marchand’s, Advertising the American Dream and Creating the Corporate Soul also inform the way I will avoid speculating on how commercial imagery was received by consumers by remaining producer focused and backing up historical arguments with a diverse pool of multidisciplinary quantitative data. In both texts, Marchand contrasts commercial imagery against broader social and economic forces to tease out cultural and psychological findings and being mindful to not reach for a one to one cause and effect between advertising and social reaction to those images. Employing this approach, I am also mindful to avoid speculation and projection inherent to studying visual resources by focusing on the producer’s output and corporate legacy rather than the consumer’s hypothetical reaction to these materials.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In conclusion, I hope this presentation has demonstrated the scholarly gaps this study would address in advertising history and the unique opportunity to study the formation of modern American advertising alongside the development of an aspirational metropolis in the Inland Empire.</p>
