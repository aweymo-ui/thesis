__This work was created as a scholarly output__ for a directed study called _Historical Perspectives of Public Relations_ taught by Dr. Caitlin Cieslik-Miskimen in Spring 2025. This paper reframes my thesis as a hypothetical course taught to 400 level undergraduates. This exercise helped me simplify language around the central project and pare down source material to the most essential authors.

## Course Introduction 

<br>

Have you ever walked around in a grocery store, looked at a billboard or watched a commercial and wondered why they were designed that way and what meaning it is attempting to convey? By analyzing commercial imagery in advertisements and the packaging of the products themselves, we can make new insights into both producers and consumers during this final period of the industrial era in the United States.  

This course will introduce students to the field of material history, which allows us to understand mass produced objects through the context of archaeology, sociology and history. It focuses on a pivotal moment in the formation of the professional advertising industry, as corporate founders leveraged consumer fears following the Civil War and later adopted progressive era language into their commercial imagery to reposition their products as tools of social betterment. Studying corporations from the United States lets us examine how company founders communicated to consumers both local and international, and how the formation of 
more distant trade routes changed the nature of their visual language. Finally, we will examine how the first world war legitimized these early approaches to marketing and public relations.  

The in-person classes will be discussion focused, examining that week’s reading materials. Discussions are student-led and professor moderated, to help undergraduates create their own connections to the material and form a collaborative knowledge base. We will begin the course with an overview of methodologies that historians have used to understand these types of materials and a brief introduction to archiving. Then the course will explore the development of industrialization in the US, the creation of the advertising and public relations industry and conclude on the different social lenses that historians have used to examine corporate imagery. Additionally, there will be one collaborative and one independent project which will teach students how to search the archives and make their own historical insights into these materials. 

<br>

## Learning Objectives 

<br>

- __Material History Methodology__: Students should understand the basic principles of material history in relation to the other major historical methodologies. 
- __Archival Competency__: Students will gain competency in what archives are, how they are created and how to search for and find materials. 
- __The Development of Industrialization__ in the United States: Students will establish a foundational knowledge of how corporate America evolved throughout this forty-year window, including governmental and public reactions to this expansion. 
- __The Development of Marketing and Public Relations in the United States__: Students 
should be able to describe the formation of this industry as well as how past scholars 
have approached this area of study. 
- __Approaches for Visual Resources__: Through reading and discussion, students will gain 
a competency in how the authors of this course utilized a diverse range of primary and 
secondary sources to examine historical visual materials. 

<br>

## Assignments 

<br>

Each week’s lesson will consist of two seventy five minute classes discussing the reading materials, developing archival skills or presenting research. Students will also compose three 350 word book reviews over the fifteen weeks engaging with the reading materials. Students select which texts they review and when they review them. The first week will include reading a chapter of a work and a review of that work to help orient students on this format. 

The midterm will be a collaborative presentation between two paired students discussing their commercial artifact that they selected from the special collections workshop on week three. Students will discuss the different ways their artifacts could be examined, its relationship to the region and what methodological approaches they might use to understand their object. These presentations will be held on week seven. 

The course will end on a six-page research paper and a 10-minute lecture by each student individually on a set of materials of their choosing which demonstrates their comprehension of the final learning objective. Think of the research paper as the more formal version of your presentation with findings and references.
