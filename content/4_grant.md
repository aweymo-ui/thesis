## The Development of Commercial Imagery in the Inland Empire Through the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era

<br>

__I am applying for this travel grant to support a ten-day research trip to Spokane, WA__, where I will work with the Spokane Art Museum Archives to digitize historical commercial imagery and related documentation. This will either involve collaborating with the Curator of History and Campbell House Ellen Postlewait to focus on a set of collections at the Joel Ferris Archive that range from documents, two-dimensional visual resources and artifacts, which I will be scanning and photographing on location. This research is a critical component of my thesis, which will produce a public facing digital project on the cultural influences that shaped commercial imagery in the Inland Empire from 1880-1920.

<br>

## Research Objectives:

<br>

- Identify and digitize key examples of early commercial imagery that reflect evolving marketing strategies.
- Analyze iconographic changes in response to industrialization and early public relations efforts.
- Examine the material and design aspects of these artifacts to understand consumer relationships with commercial products.

<br>

## Methodology & Timeline:

<br>

- __February 19th__: Remote meeting with Ellen Postlewait to discuss scope, potential collections and ability to digitize collections and make them publicly available for this project. 
- __May 27th__: Introduction to staff, orientation for archive procedures and setting up workspace.
- __May 28-31__-: Digitization of selected materials through scanning or photography at the Joel E. Ferris Research Archives located in the Northwest Museum of Arts & Culture.
- __June 1-3__: Contextual research in other archives such as The Inland Northwest Special Collections, Eastern Regional Branch of the Washington State Archives, Foley Center Library at Gonzaga University or early commercial sites in and around Spokane to supplement visual materials with historical documentation.
- __June 4-5__: Digitization of selected materials through scanning or photography at the Joel E. Ferris Research Archives located in the Northwest Museum of Arts & Culture.
- __June 6__: Wrap-up meetings and review of collected materials with the archive staff.

<br>

## Expected Outcomes:

<br>

The high-resolution images obtained from this research will form the foundation of a public-facing digital project that allows researchers and the general public to explore the evolution of commercial imagery in the Inland Empire and greater Pacific Northwest. By providing interactive features such as zoom functionality, the digital archive will facilitate an in-depth examination of design elements, material textures, and marketing strategies over time.

<br>

## Budget & Justification:

<br>

The requested funds will cover lodging and mileage expenses for the ten-day research trip. 

I appreciate your consideration of my application. Please feel free to contact me with any questions regarding this proposal.

Sincerely,
Andrew Weymouth
