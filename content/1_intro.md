**Hello, my name is Andrew Weymouth** and I have worked with the University of Idaho Library as the [Digital Initiatives Librarian](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/about/people/aweymouth.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (CDIL) department since the fall of 2023. My work generally consists of creating and maintaining our digital collections, working with fellowship recipients, helping to rethink processes and introducing new digital scholarship tools to the department.

<br>

## Why?

This workflow was prompted by my pursuing masterâ€™s in History with University of Idaho in the fall of 2024 while also working as a faculty member with the library. I wanted to create a note taking system that could visualize connections across all of the literature I am reading to create historiographies specifically, but would also be helpful while creating literature reviews, scientific reviews and environmental scans that I need to do to create scholarly writing. Beyond history, Obsidian is also a popular knowledge organization tool for scholars working in computer and data science, mathematics, physics, biology and medicine. 

I was initially inspired by a Tech Talk I attended last year by interdisciplinary botany PhD Student and previous CDIL Fellowship recipient Nick Koenig. The presentation centered on using Obsidian for research and they mentioned that there were community plug-ins that were developed to connect Zotero to the platform. After testing out these tools, I wanted to find out if there was a more reliable and more customizable solution for connecting these two platforms that not only extracted annotated material but also categorized annotations according to highlight color.

## Zotero

**Zotero is an open source reference management software** developed by the Corporation for Digital Scholarship (formerly by the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University) in 2006. Since jumping from an academic tool to incorporation in 2013, the software has gained widespread adoption by academics, students and researchers as a more versatile and digital preservation focused alternative to other citation managers like EndNote and Mendeley.

Zotero's excels as a temporary processing station for research, where you can drop all of your research, easily record website using a browser plug-in, annotate in your preferred word processor and then export in a lightweight file that can be opened again in Zotero whenever you need it again. Also, unlike Obsidian, it is very convenient to share reading material in shared libraries, which is helpful for conducting literature reviews.

## Obsidian

**Obsidian was founded in 2020** as a markdown file based knowledge management tool that has a very active user base and regularly updates systems based on that feedback. Obsidian supports the use of multiple computer languages, including JavaScript, HTML and CSS but, as we will see later, **you can do as much or as little coding as you are interested in.** 

Obsidian workspaces are called "vaults" and they are essentially just folders of markdown files. How you choose to structure the folders within your vault allows you to highlight and visualize your research, which we will explore in greater detail further along in this workshop.

Unlike cloud-based note taking apps, Obsidian is designed to be fully functional on your local device, not even requiring an internet connection, which is key if you are working on a privacy-oriented project with sensitive data. While Obsidian has a subscription cloud based version called Sync, this workshop will show you how to host your site on a free cloud like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive so you can have your vaults sync between devices at no additional cost.

Obsidian's central strength is it's ability to link notes, tags and subtags together, creating an interconnected "web of knowledge". The built in **graph** view allows researchers provides a visual representation of these connections, which can be very helpful in understanding  themes and relationships between huge amounts of text. Additionally, I find that the process of creating tags and thinking about the ways they may or may not apply to different subject matter is an interactive process that makes the material more engaging and causes me to think about it in new ways.
